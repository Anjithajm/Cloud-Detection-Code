# Cloud Detection in Satellite Images

## Problem
Detect whether a satellite image patch is cloud-covered or clear.
Cloud detection is a critical preprocessing step in Earth Observation pipelines.

## Dataset
EuroSAT (Sentinel-2 RGB image patches)

## Method
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Binary classification (Cloudy / Clear)
- Implemented in TensorFlow/Keras

## Results
Baseline CNN achieves reasonable accuracy on validation data.
This project serves as a simple end-to-end ML pipeline example.

## Industry relevance
Cloud masking is widely used in satellite data processing
for Earth Observation and space industry applications.
